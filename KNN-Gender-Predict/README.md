# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression Project

# Gender classification based on height and weight

## Project Overview
This project involves using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze the relationship between physical attributes (such as weight and height) and a target variable. The elbow method is used to determine the optimal number of neighbors \( K \) for the KNN algorithm.


## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict the target variable using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and visualize the relationship between the chosen features and the predictions. This helps in understanding the model's performance and optimizing the value of \( K \). This is a very basic classification problem where I classify whether a person is male or female given his weight and height.

## Dataset
- **Description**: The dataset contains various features, including weight, height, and other attributes relevant to the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed outliers and handled missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created necessary features and transformed categorical variables.
3. **Data Visualization**: Visualized the data using scatter plots and error rate graphs.
4. **Model Training**: Implemented the KNN algorithm using different values of \( K \).
5. **Error Rate Calculation**: Used the elbow method to determine the optimal \( K \).
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results
- Error Rate vs. K Value plot shows the performance of the model as the number of neighbors changes.
- Optimal \( K \) value identified through the elbow method.
